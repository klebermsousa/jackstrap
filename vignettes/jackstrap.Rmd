```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

When working with data you must:

* Figure out what you want to do.

* Describe those tasks in the form of a computer program.

* Execute the program.

The dplyr package makes these steps fast and easy:

* By constraining your options, it helps you think about your data manipulation 
  challenges.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
